# Intro_DSP_voice
This is the code I generated in my Youtube videos. It is a step by step on generating a .wav file, reading it into to a Python interpreter, displaying the time domain signal, then generating the frequency domain representation, implementing a very crude high-pass filter, then returning the signal to the time domain and writing a new .wav file.

You will need a few python packages to run and execute this code. I step through them in my videos. All of them should be readily accessible.

I am using Python 3.9 and my IDE is PyCharm from Jetbrains.
